# RECOMMENDATIONS

1. The supermarket can introduce evening promotions, such as "  Discounts hours " or flash sales between 5-8 PM to further boost sales during peak hours.
2. The supermarket should focus on increasing membership enrollments by offering exclusive discounts, early access to new products, or reward points to further encourage customer retention.
3. The supermarket can create product bundles, such as “Buy a Beverage + Snack Combo” at a discounted rate, to encourage cross-selling and increase basket size.
4. The supermarket should tailor checkout experiences by promoting preferred payment methods in each city. For example, offering cashback on digital payments where they are less used can encourage adoption.
5. The supermarket should conduct branch-wise audits, improve inventory management, and enhance customer service at the underperforming location. Introducing branch-specific discounts or events can also help boost sales.
